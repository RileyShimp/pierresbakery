## Setup/Installation Requirements

### Step 1
Clone the repository:
``` 
$ git clone https://github.com/RileyShimp/pierresbakery.git 
```
### Step 2
First we'll install .NET, which provides access to the C# language. Follow along with instructions for your operating system provided in the following link: 
https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/getting-started-with-c/installing-c-and-net

### Step 3
Now .NET and C# should be installed and your computer should recognize the `dotnet` command.
Navigate to the `PierresBakery.Solution` directory in your computer terminal and then to the `PierresBakery` folder.

### Step 4
Once in the `PierresBakery` folder, run the command `dotnet run`

### Steps for testing
After completing steps 1 and 2, you can run tests in your terminal.

To do this, navigate to the `PierresBakery.Tests` folder and run the command `dotnet restore`
This command automatically creates new obj directories in PierresBakery and PierresBakery.Tests

Finally, we will run `dotnet test` and the tests will run.

Specific tests are written and can be found in the "tests" folder.
